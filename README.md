LimitSwap is a trading bot for UniSwap & Many Other DEXs. It has the ability to scan multiple pairs on uniswap and grab the price in realtime and make automated trading decisions based on the users settings [AKA: Limit Orders]

==> And it's done! ‚úÖ

Simply **double-click on "LimitSwap.py"** and it will run, since you've installed Python üëçüëç

&nbsp;

#### Pros and cons
üü¢ : you are sure of the code that is running on your computer

üî¥ : little bit complicated

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### 2. Download the pre-compiled package [*This can lag behind current version*]
That we provide on the Release page : it's a .exe file that you can run on your computer.
https://github.com/CryptoGnome/LimitSwap/releases

#### Pros and cons
üü¢ : very easy to setup

üî¥ : it's pre-compiled, so you cannot check the Source Code

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### 3. With Docker

#### Requirements
MacOS and Windows users require Docker for Desktop https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
Ubuntu Linux require Docker installed `sudo apt-get install docker.io`

#### Usage
Navigate into the bot directory and build the Docker image by executing the following command:

`docker build -t limit_swap_v4 .`

(For MacOS and Linux) Still within the main directory you can run Docker via:

`docker run --rm --name limit-swap_v4 -it -v $(pwd)/settings.json:/app/settings.json -v $(pwd)/tokens.json:/app/tokens.json limit_swap_v4`

(For Windows with Powershell)

`docker run --rm --name limit-swap_v4 -it -v $PWD/settings.json:/app/settings.json -v $PWD/tokens.json:/app/tokens.json limit_swap_v4`

If you wish to run the container in the background please include -d for detached.

The streaming container logs can be visualised with `docker logs -f limit_swap_v4`

To stop the bot `docker stop limit_swap_v4`

#### Pros and cons
üü¢ : easy to setup if you know Docker
